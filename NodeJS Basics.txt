node -v
Returns version

node basically runs javascript locally
Takes chrome’s V8 engine and uses it on your computer rather than attaching it to an HTML document
Creates a server 
Javascript doesn’t have ‘document’ or ‘window’

Node also built in npm
packages are like libraries
Super easy way to install common things

-Share these dependencies:
nam init
Creates a package.json

‘npm install’
Will install all the modules

nam install backbone -S
Stores package (‘backbone’) in package json so all github users can use it



var m2 = require(‘./module2’); //Assumes js file

Need to export your data in module2 otherwise it just reads an empty object

var http = require(‘http’);

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
	//Every time server hears something at port 3000, will respond with this:
	console.log(‘got a request!’); //Returns in the terminal
	response.write(‘hi’); //Sends the window content
	response.end();
});

server.listen(3000);
